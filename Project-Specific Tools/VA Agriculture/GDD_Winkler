##At this point, my Daily Interpolated Lows and DInt Highs were in separate folders,
##with names that consisted of only digits, referring to the day of the year (1-365)
##so I ran this section twice, and just copy-and-pasted them into a single folder,
##then put them all in the workspace together so that I had one folder containing files
##with the naming scheme 103_L.tif and 103_H.tif from 1 to 365. This guarantees that
##rasters from the day are consecutive in the list generated by arcpy.ListRasters().

    ##Unfortunately the rasters are generated in the GRID format, but we'll convert them to tiff later
    i = i + 2
    j = j + 2
    count = count + 1
##NOTE: This while loop will end in an error because count will hit 366 and python will get
##upset, but it will correctly generate the average for each day so who cares
##After the error message, you can check that the resulting rasters are actually the
##averages you want by manually running the Raster Calculator tool on a randomly chosen
##day and subtracting the automaticcaly generated average (from above); if it worked,
##this result will be zero.

##Now redfine the list of rasters to select only the averages (avg_day366), and print to
##check that you have correctly chosen your rasters
rasters = arcpy.ListRasters("*", "GRID")
    print rasters

##If successful, run the following code. It will subtract the base temperature (283.15K or
##10*C) from all values and create a new raster appended with the letter m for Minus
outMinus = "C:\Users\strimble\Documents\Raster\Daily\DIntMea\DIntMea_Avg" + "\\" + raster + "m"
arcpy.env.overwriteOutput = True
for raster in rasters:
    outMinus = "C:\Users\strimble\Documents\Raster\Daily\DIntMea\DIntMea_Avg" + "\\" + raster + "m"
    minus = Minus(raster, 283.15)
    minus.save(outMinus)

##The subtraction (above) will generate negative values for pixels where the average
##temperature on that day was less than 283.15%/10*C so to remove all of these this code
##will set all negative pixel values to NoData. This process will not work with the GRID
##filetype, so it's time to convert to another file format. I chose TIFF.
##First, convert:
rasters = arcpy.ListRasters("*m", "GRID")
i = 0
inRast = rasters[i]
for raster in rasters:
    inRast = raster[i]
    arcpy.CopyRaster_management(inRast, inRast + ".tif")
    i = 1 + 1
##Second, set all negative values to NoData:
i = 0
rasters = arcpy.ListRasters("*tif", "*")
inRast = rasters[i]
for raster in rasters:
    inRast = rasters[i]
    outSetNull = SetNull(inRast, inRast, "VALUE < 0")
    outSetNull.save(inRast + "z")
    i = i + 1

##Sum all rasters to generate tiff of Growding Degree Days (GDD) according to the Winkler Index
rasters = arcpy.ListRasters("*z", "*")
GDD = CellStatistics([rasters], "SUM", "DATA")
GDD.save("C:\Users\strimble\Documents\Raster\Daily\DIntMea\DIntMea_Avg" + "\\" + "GDD")
